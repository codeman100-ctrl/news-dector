"Fuel control switches to the engines of an Air India flight that crashed shortly after takeoff, killing 260 people, were moved from the ""run"" to the ""cutoff"" position moments before impact, a preliminary investigation report said early Saturday.

The report, issued by India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB), said that the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) had issued an information bulletin in 2018 about ""the potential disengagement of the fuel control switch locking feature"".

Though the concern was not considered an ""unsafe condition"" that would warrant a more serious directive, Air India told investigators it did not carry out suggested inspections as they were ""advisory and not mandatory"".

Fuel control switches regulate the flow of fuel into an aircraft's engines. 

Air India Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner was headed from Ahmedabad to London when it crashed, killing all but one of the 242 people on board as well as 19 people on the ground.

""The FAA issued Special Airworthiness Information Bulletin (SAIB) No. NM-18-33 on December 17, 2018, regarding the potential disengagement of the fuel control switch locking feature,"" said the preliminary report.

Air India was compliant with all airworthiness directives and alert service bulletins on the aircraft, the report said.

""This SAIB was issued based on reports from operators of Model 737 airplanes that the fuel control switches were installed with the locking feature disengaged. The airworthiness concern was not considered an unsafe condition that would warrant airworthiness directive (AD) by the FAA,"" it said.  

""As per the information from Air India, the suggested inspections were not carried out as the SAIB was advisory and not mandatory. The scrutiny of maintenance records revealed that the throttle control module was replaced on VT-ANB in 2019 and 2023,"" it added.

The fuel switch has two positions -- 'RUN' and 'CUT OFF' -- and are used to start or shut down engines.

In its 15-page report, the investigation bureau said that once the aircraft achieved its top recorded speed, ""the Engine 1 and Engine 2 fuel cutoff switches transitioned from RUN to CUTOFF position one after another with a time gap of 01 sec"".

The switches then returned to the ""RUN"" position and the engines appeared to be gathering power, but ""one of the pilots transmitted 'MAYDAY MAYDAY MAYDAY'"", the report said.

The report did not offer any conclusions or apportion blame for the June 12 disaster, but indicated that one pilot asked the other why he cut off fuel, and the second pilot responded that he had not.

Boeing said in a statement it will ""continue to support the investigation and our customer"", adding ""our thoughts remain"" with those affected by the disaster.  

Air India said it was ""working closely with stakeholders, including regulators."" 

""We continue to fully cooperate with the AAIB and other authorities as their investigation progresses,"" it said in a statement on X.",Real News,75.03,True,2025-07-13T01:02:28.170946

"Congress is officially sending a package detailing $9 billion in spending cuts to President Donald Trump’s desk, minutes after midnight on Friday.

The bill, called a ""rescissions package,"" was approved by the House of Representatives in a late-night 216 to 213 vote after intense debate between Republicans and Democrats. Just two Republicans, Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa., and Mike Turner, R-Ohio, voted in opposition.

Friday was also the deadline for passing the legislation, otherwise the White House would be forced to re-obligate those funds as planned.

It’s a victory for House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., but a mostly symbolic one – the spending cuts bill was largely seen by Trump allies as a test run of a fiscal claw-back process not used in more than two decades.

""This bill tonight is part of continuing that trend of getting spending under control. Does it answer all the problems? No. $9 billion, I would say is a good start,"" House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., said during debate on the bill.

When signed by Trump, it will block $8 billion in funding to the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and $1 billion to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting for the remainder of the fiscal year. The dollars had been allocated by Congress for the duration of fiscal year 2025.

Republicans celebrated it as a victory for cutting off the flow of U.S. taxpayer dollars to what they called ""woke"" initiatives abroad, while Democrats accused the right of gutting critical foreign aid.

Rescissions packages are a way for the president to have input in Congress’ yearly appropriations process. The White House sends a proposal to block some congressionally obligated funds, which lawmakers have 45 days to get through the House and Senate.

Republicans have also been able to sideline Democrats so far, with the rescissions process lowering the Senate’s threshold for passage from 60 votes to 51.

The last time a rescissions package was signed into law was 1999.

Consideration of the bill began with a House Rules Committee hearing at 6 p.m. on Thursday evening.

Rep. Jim McGovern

Democrats attempted multiple times throughout the process to weaponize the ongoing inter-GOP fallout over the Jeffrey Epstein case, both in the House Rules Committee and on the chamber floor during debate on the bill. 

Multiple calls were made for votes to force the release of the so-called Epstein ""files.""

""If every Republican votes to block our attempt to release the records, they are telling Epstein's victims, you don't matter as much as our political convenience. And that should disgust every single one of us,"" said Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass.

Far-right GOP figures are demanding accountability, while Trump has called on his base to move on after the Department of Justice (DOJ) signaled the case was closed.

Initial plans to begin advancing the bill earlier in the day were quickly scuttled, with Republicans on the committee being concerned about being put into a difficult position with potential Epstein votes.

In the end, a compromise led to the House Rules Committee advancing a separate nonbinding measure dealing with Epstein transparency, on a parallel track to the rescissions bill.",Fake News,81.48,True,2025-07-18T11:52:13.224957
"White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt revealed additional details about President Donald Trump's health after photos showed some bruising on the back of his hands and apparently swollen legs. 

""I know that many in the media have been speculating about bruising on the president's hand and also swelling in the president's legs,"" she said Thursday. ""So, in the effort of transparency, the president wanted me to share a note from his physician with all of you today.""

Leavitt read a memo explaining that the swollen legs were part of a ""benign and common condition"" for individuals older than age 70, while the bruising on his hands was attributable to ""frequent handshaking and the use of aspirin.""

""In recent weeks, President Trump noted mild swelling in his lower legs,"" Leavitt said Thursday during a press briefing. ""In keeping with routine medical care and out of an abundance of caution, this concern was thoroughly evaluated by the White House Medical Unit.

""The president underwent a comprehensive examination, including diagnostic vascular studies, bilateral lower extremity … venous Doppler ultrasounds were performed and revealed chronic venous insufficiency, a benign and common condition, particularly in individuals over the age of 70,"" Leavitt said.

""Importantly, there was no evidence of deep vein thrombosis or arterial disease,"" she continued. ""Laboratory testing included a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel coagulation profile, D-dimer, B-type natriuretic peptide and cardiac biomarkers. All results were within normal limits. An echocardiogram was also performed and confirmed normal cardiac structure and function. No signs of heart failure, renal impairment or systemic illness were identified.""

Photos of Trump's swollen legs circulated in July, when he attended the FIFA Club World Cup final Sunday at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey accompanied by first lady Melania Trump, prompting headlines and social media speculation that the president was concealing a health issue. While concern also spread after photos of Trump's hands showed bruising when he met with Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa, the prime minister of the Kingdom of Bahrain, Wednesday.

Leavitt explained the bruising on the back of Trump's hands was due to his aspirin intake and frequently shaking hands with other people. 

""Additionally, recent photos of the president have shown minor bruising on the back of his hand,"" Leavitt said. ""This is consistent with minor soft tissue irritation from frequent handshaking and the use of aspirin, which is taken as part of a standard cardiovascular prevention regimen.
