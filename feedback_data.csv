"Christian Horner has been released from his post as Red Bull’s team principal with immediate effect. Horner, who was reportedly reduced to tears when he informed his staff, has been in charge of Red Bull since the team was formed in 2005 and will be replaced by Laurent Mekies, the principal of their sister team, Racing Bulls.

Horner’s surprise removal as principal and chief executive of Red Bull Racing was confirmed in a statement from the team’s parent company on Wednesday morning and comes just over 17 months after he was embroiled in a scandal involving accusations of inappropriate behaviour by an employee, though he was later cleared by an investigation.

Horner has yet to comment and Red Bull have only issued a statement confirming that Mekies has been appointed as team principal and CEO, with all inquiries relating to the decision to the Red Bull team being directed toward the parent company Red Bull GmbH.

However, the former F1 driver Martin Brundle, a friend of Horner, said: “Christian has told me ‘no reason was given to him’ as to why he’s been released.

“I don’t think it is completely out of the blue given the things that are going on and the problems in the team. I am quite sad about it as I consider Christian a friend and he has done an incredible job for 20 years and won an awful lot of races and world championships for drivers and the team.

“But it has not been difficult in the Formula One paddock to observe and hear that things were not particularly rosy.”

Having been informed of the decision, an emotional Horner travelled to the team’s Milton Keynes factory to tell staff in person. Having done so a statement was publicly released by the parent company.

The world champion, Max Verstappen, was not in attendance but he later posted on social media a picture of him celebrating with Horner and wrote: “From my first race win, to four world championships, we have shared incredible successes. Winning memorable races and breaking countless records. Thank you for everything, Christian.”

The statement from Red Bull GmbH read: “Red Bull has released Christian Horner from his operational duties with effect from today [Wednesday 9 July 2025] and has appointed Laurent Mekies as CEO of Red Bull Racing. Oliver Mintzlaff, CEO Corporate Projects and Investments, thanked Christian Horner for his exceptional work over the last 20 years.”

“We would like to thank Christian Horner for his exceptional work over the last 20 years,” said Mintzlaff. “With his tireless commitment, experience, expertise and innovative thinking, he has been instrumental in establishing Red Bull Racing as one of the most successful and attractive teams in Formula One. Thank you for everything, Christian, and you will forever remain an important part of our team history.”

Under the 51-year-old’s leadership Red Bull have won eight drivers’ championships and six constructors’ championships as one of Formula One’s most successful teams. However, during the investigation into Horner’s behaviour it was understood there had been a power struggle between Horner and the parent company, with Jos Verstappen, the father of Max, openly calling for him to be removed. Horner appeared to have weathered that storm and attended Silverstone at the weekend and the paddock did not expect his sacking to take place.

Horner took on his role when Red Bull bought the ailing Jaguar team at the end of 2004. At 31 he became the youngest team principal in F1 and 20 years later he leaves as the longest serving of the current principals.

He oversaw four drivers’ and constructors’ world championships with Sebastian Vettel between 2010 and 2013 and then a resurgence after seven years of Mercedes dominance for Max Verstappen to take the first of his four consecutive titles in 2021. All of those were in cars designed by Adrian Newey, the most successful designer in F1’s modern era, who left to join Aston Martin last year.

Horner has enjoyed remarkable success but in the past two years Red Bull have struggled. They have lost key personnel and in 2025 their car has been thoroughly outpaced by McLaren and at times by Mercedes and Ferrari. Verstappen, who was fifth at last weekend’s British GP, is now 69 points behind the championship leader, Oscar Piastri, and has conceded he does not believe he is in the title fight.

Racing Bulls have confirmed that their racing director, Alan Permane, will replace Mekies as their principal. The 48-year-old Mekies has been team principal at Racing Bulls since the start of 2024 and was previously racing director at Ferrari.",Fake News,84.22,False,2025-07-10T01:25:04.235295
"Doctors in Gaza say they were forced to cram multiple babies into one incubator as hospitals warned that fuel shortages are forcing them to shut off vital services, putting patients’ lives at risk.

The UN has warned that the fuel crisis is at a critical point, with the little supplies that are available running short and “virtually no additional accessible stocks left.”

“Hospitals are rationing. Ambulances are stalling. Water systems are on the brink. And the deaths this is likely causing could soon rise sharply unless the Israeli authorities allow new fuel in – urgently, regularly and in sufficient quantities,” the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said.

An 11-week Israeli blockade on humanitarian aid earlier in the year pushed the enclave’s population of more than 2 million Palestinians towards famine and into a deepening humanitarian crisis. Limited aid deliveries resumed into the besieged enclave in May but aid groups have said it is not nearly enough to meet the scale of the needs.

CNN has approached COGAT, the Israeli agency in charge of coordinating aid deliveries into Gaza, for comment about the fuel shortages.

The director of the Al-Ahli Hospital, south of Gaza City posted a photo on social media Wednesday of multiple newborn babies sharing a single incubator which was taken at another facility, Al-Helou.

“This tragic overcrowding is not just a matter of missing equipment — it’s a direct consequence of the relentless war on Gaza and the suffocating blockade that has crippled the entire healthcare system,” Dr. Fadel Naim wrote in a post on X.

“The siege has turned routine care for premature babies into a life-or-death struggle. No child should be born into a world where bombs and blockades decide whether they live or die.”

The director of Al-Shifa Hospital in northern Gaza said the shortages were forcing them to close kidney dialysis sections so they could focus on intensive care and operating theatres.

“If the fuel is not made available in the next few hours to Al-Shifa hospital, the hospital will become out of service in the next three hours and this will lead to high number of deaths,” Dr. Mohammad Abu Silmiya told CNN, saying hundreds of patients were at risk, including 22 babies in incubators.

Footage from inside the hospital showed doctors using flashlights as they treated patients.

Another facility, the Nasser Medical Complex, said it had 24 hours of fuel left and was concentrating on vital departments such as maternity and intensive care.

Fuel vital for basic services
In addition to fuel shortages, difficulty finding replacement parts for the generators that power Gaza’s hospitals risks is forcing more to shut down.

“Not only the fuel is a major problem for us to run the generators of the hospitals, our main problem now is finding spare parts for the generators to replace old ones,” Gaza’s health ministry told CNN on Wednesday.

The Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in central Gaza issued an urgent statement that the facility’s main generator had broken down due to a lack of spare parts, forcing it to rely on a smaller backup unit.

“Fuel will run out within the coming hours, and the lives of hundreds of patients are at risk inside the hospital wards,” the statement said.

“The hospital’s shutdown threatens to disrupt healthcare services for half a million people in the Central Governorate.”

Beyond hospitals, fuel is essential to keep basic services running in Gaza. The territory relies heavily on imports for cooking, desalination and wastewater plants, and to power the vehicles used in rescue efforts.

Israel has restricted the entry of fuel throughout the conflict, and has previously claimed Hamas could use it to launch weapons.

The aid group Doctors Without Borders (MSF) warned of what it called “an unprecedented humanitarian crisis” unfolding in Gaza, in a statement Tuesday and called for a ceasefire and the entry of far greater levels of humanitarian aid.

“Our teams have worked to treat the wounded and supply overwhelmed hospitals as indiscriminate attacks and a state of siege threaten millions of men, women and children,” MSF said.

“We urge Israeli authorities and the complicit governments that enable these atrocities, including the UK Government, to end the siege now and take action to prevent the erasure of Palestinians from Gaza.”",Real News,87.12,False,2025-07-10T01:26:20.854084
"Donald Trump has said the US will impose a 35% tariff on imports from Canada from the beginning of August, and threatened to impose blanket tariffs of 15% or 20% on most other trading partners.

The US president sent a letter to Canada late on Thursday, after an interview in which he warned EU nations to expect a tariff announcement “today or tomorrow”.

Countries that do not receive a letter from Trump face larger tariffs than those that have a agreed a “reciprocal” deal at a rate of 10%.

“We’re just going to say all of the remaining countries are going to pay, whether it’s 20% or 15%,” Trump said in an interview with NBC News. “We’ll work that out now.”

The surprise declaration has made the EU nervous that the president could change his mind on signing an agreement in principle negotiated between the two sides to ease the transatlantic trade war.

Brussels has €21bn worth of retaliatory tariffs on US imports ready to come into force at midnight on Monday, but a spokesperson confirmed they could be paused in the event Trump signed off on the framework.

In a letter released on his social media platform late on Thursday, Trump told the Canadian prime minister, Mark Carney, that the new rate for his country would come into effect on 1 August and would be increased in the event of any retaliation.

Carney wrote on social media that his government would continue to defend Canadian workers and businesses in their negotiations with the US as they worked toward that deadline.

“Throughout the current trade negotiations with the United States, the Canadian government has steadfastly defended our workers and businesses,” he said in a post on X. “We will continue to do so as we work towards the revised deadline of 1 August.”

In his letter to Carney, Trump also complained about what he referred to as the flow of fentanyl from Canada. “If Canada works with me to stop the flow of fentanyl, we will, perhaps, consider an adjustment to this letter,” Trump wrote.


Canadian officials say a minuscule amount of fentanyl entering the US originates from Canada. Carney reminded Trump of the role that Canada plays in the battle to reduce the amount of the powerful opioid coming into North America.

“Canada has made vital progress to stop the scourge of fentanyl in North America,” Carney said. “We are committed to continuing to work with the United States to save lives and protect communities in both our countries.”

Former US government officials have warned that Trump’s trade policies could make the US more vulnerable to dangerous synthetic drug trafficking from abroad.

A US administration official said that tariffs on goods covered by Trump’s 2020 United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) on trade would “likely” be waived, but that “no final decisions” had been made.

Such an exclusion would significantly blunt the impact of Trump’s tariff increase on Canada.

In March, Trump imposed a 25% tariff on cars and auto parts imported from Canada. In June he announced a 50% tariff on Canadian steel and aluminium imports. The new rate would apply to all other goods.

US shoppers feel the heat of Trump’s trade war: ‘the prices are going up’
Read more
Canada and the US are locked in trade negotiations in the hope of reaching a deal, but the latest threat seemed to put that date in jeopardy.

It was the latest of more than 20 such letters issued by Trump since Monday, as he continues to pursue his trade war threats against dozens of economies.

However the new tariff rates set by Trump this week could all be reduced to zero if the administration loses its appeal later this month of an adverse ruling by the US court of international trade, which found in May that the president had acted beyond his legal authority by using emergency powers to impose tariffs in the absence of an actual emergency.

That hearing at the US court of appeals for the federal circuit in Washington is scheduled for 10am local time on 31 July.

Canada and Mexico are trying to find ways to satisfy Trump so that the free trade deal uniting the three countries can be put back on track.

The USMCA replaced the previous Nafta accord in July 2020, after Trump successfully pushed for a renegotiation during his first term in office. It was due to be reviewed by July next year but Trump has thrown the process into disarray by launching his trade wars after he took office in January.

Earlier this year, Canadian and Mexican products were slapped with 25% US tariffs, with a lower rate for Canadian energy. Trump targeted both neighbours, saying they did not do enough on illegal immigration and the flow of illicit drugs across borders.

He eventually announced exemptions for goods entering his country under the USMCA, covering large numbers of products.

Thursday’s letter to Carney comes despite continuing trade negotiations and what many had seen as warming relations between Trump and the Canadian prime minister. Carney came to the White House on 6 May and had a cordial meeting with Trump in the Oval Office.

After Trump called off trade talks last month because of Canada’s newly imposed digital services tax, Carney agreed to rescind the levy, which would have affected US tech companies.

Trump has broadened his trade war in recent days, threatening new tariffs on a number of countries, including the allies Japan and South Korea, along with a promised 50% tariff on copper.

In an interview with NBC News published on Thursday, Trump said other trading partners that had not yet received such letters could face blanket tariffs.

“Not everybody has to get a letter. You know that. We’re just setting our tariffs,” Trump said. “We’re just going to say all of the remaining countries are going to pay, whether it’s 20% or 15%. We’ll work that out now.”

There is a lot at stake
The world’s most powerful man is using his office to punish journalistic organisations that won’t follow his orders or who report critically on his policies. Donald Trump’s actions against the press include bans, lawsuits and hand-picking his own pool of reporters. 

But the global threat against the press is bigger than just Trump.

Economic and authoritarian forces around the globe are challenging journalists’ ability to report. An independent press, one that those in power can’t simply overrule, is crucial to democracy. Figures such as Trump and Hungary’s Viktor Orbán want to crush it through exclusion and influence. 

The Guardian is a global news organisation that will stand up to attacks on the free press. We have no interest serving those with immense power or immense wealth.  

We are owned by an independent trust devoted only to protecting and defending our journalism. That means we don’t have a billionaire owner dictating what our reporters can cover or what opinions our columnists can have, or shareholders demanding a quick return.

The global situation is shifting hour by hour, making this an extremely challenging moment. It will take brave, well-funded, committed, quality journalism to call out what is happening. 

Our job is to make sure we do not get overwhelmed as Trump floods the zone. We must focus on the stories that will make the biggest impact on people’s lives, while holding the powerful to account. We’ll also continue to focus on the ideas people need to create a better world: a reason for hope. 

As the writer and Guardian columnist Rebecca Solnit says: “authentic hope requires clarity … and imagination”.

The Guardian can provide both and, with the help of readers like you in Saudi Arabia, we can drive hope by reporting truthfully on what is happening and never pulling our punches.

"A federal judge in New Hampshire blocked President Donald Trump's executive order banning birthright citizenship and granted nationwide class certification status to all infants impacted by the order on Thursday.

U.S. District Judge Joseph LaPlante said he will issue a written ruling by the end of the day further explaining his decision. The injunction also narrows down the scope of the class to infants, removing parents from the case. 

In his order, LaPlante ruled that deprivation of citizenship, as held by the 14th Amendment, and changes in long-standing policy would create ""irreparable harm.""

"The Kurdish militant group PKK will begin laying down its arms on Friday, marking the start of a disarmament process aimed at ending one of the Middle East’s longest-running insurgencies.

A group of fighters from the Kurdistan Workers’ Party will hand over its weapons at a ceremony in Iraq’s semi-autonomous Kurdish region attended by observers from Turkey, Iraq’s central government and the Kurdistan Regional Government, according to the Hurriyet daily.

The handover will be the first concrete step toward disarmament since the PKK’s May announcement that it would disband, ending four decades of conflict with the Turkish state and easing security concerns in the region. 

Peace could also boost Turkey’s economy, with policymakers saying that the conflict has cost the country around $1.8 trillion including lost opportunities due to military spending. 


It remains unclear whether all armed PKK factions will participate in the process. Turkey’s government has called for it take no longer than five months.

In a video message released Wednesday, the PKK’s imprisoned leader Abdullah Ocalan described the handover as “transition from the phase of armed conflict to the phase of democratic politics and law.” He has been serving a life sentence in solitary confinement on the prison island of Imrali since 1999.

The group, which first took up arms in 1984 seeking Kurdish autonomy, is designated a terrorist organization by Turkey, the US and the European Union. The conflict has killed more than 40,000 people, with violence at times spilling into neighboring Iraq, Syria and Iran.

"Fuel control switches to the engines of an Air India flight that crashed shortly after takeoff, killing 260 people, were moved from the ""run"" to the ""cutoff"" position moments before impact, a preliminary investigation report said early Saturday.

The report, issued by India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB), said that the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) had issued an information bulletin in 2018 about ""the potential disengagement of the fuel control switch locking feature"".

Though the concern was not considered an ""unsafe condition"" that would warrant a more serious directive, Air India told investigators it did not carry out suggested inspections as they were ""advisory and not mandatory"".

Fuel control switches regulate the flow of fuel into an aircraft's engines. 

Air India Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner was headed from Ahmedabad to London when it crashed, killing all but one of the 242 people on board as well as 19 people on the ground.

""The FAA issued Special Airworthiness Information Bulletin (SAIB) No. NM-18-33 on December 17, 2018, regarding the potential disengagement of the fuel control switch locking feature,"" said the preliminary report.

Air India was compliant with all airworthiness directives and alert service bulletins on the aircraft, the report said.

""This SAIB was issued based on reports from operators of Model 737 airplanes that the fuel control switches were installed with the locking feature disengaged. The airworthiness concern was not considered an unsafe condition that would warrant airworthiness directive (AD) by the FAA,"" it said.  

""As per the information from Air India, the suggested inspections were not carried out as the SAIB was advisory and not mandatory. The scrutiny of maintenance records revealed that the throttle control module was replaced on VT-ANB in 2019 and 2023,"" it added.

The fuel switch has two positions -- 'RUN' and 'CUT OFF' -- and are used to start or shut down engines.

In its 15-page report, the investigation bureau said that once the aircraft achieved its top recorded speed, ""the Engine 1 and Engine 2 fuel cutoff switches transitioned from RUN to CUTOFF position one after another with a time gap of 01 sec"".

The switches then returned to the ""RUN"" position and the engines appeared to be gathering power, but ""one of the pilots transmitted 'MAYDAY MAYDAY MAYDAY'"", the report said.

The report did not offer any conclusions or apportion blame for the June 12 disaster, but indicated that one pilot asked the other why he cut off fuel, and the second pilot responded that he had not.

Boeing said in a statement it will ""continue to support the investigation and our customer"", adding ""our thoughts remain"" with those affected by the disaster.  

Air India said it was ""working closely with stakeholders, including regulators."" 

""We continue to fully cooperate with the AAIB and other authorities as their investigation progresses,"" it said in a statement on X.",Real News,82.82,True,2025-07-12T16:55:43.985082
